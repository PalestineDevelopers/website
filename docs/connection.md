## Features

* Periodic internet connection tests
* dispose method

## Getting started

To start, import package

```dart
import 'package:palestine_connection/palestine_connection.dart';
```

## Usage

Just as easy as this

```dart
final PalConnection connection = PalConnection();
connection.initialize(
    domain: PalDomain.random, // Domain To Test On (optional)
    periodicInSeconds: 3, // 3 seconds
    onConnectionLost: () {
      // No Internet
    },
    onConnectionRestored: () {
      // Internet is back
    },
  );
```

It could get more easier actually

```dart
PalConnection().initialize(
    periodicInSeconds: 3, // 3 seconds
    onConnectionLost: () {
      // No Internet
    },
    onConnectionRestored: () {
      // Internet is back
    },
  );
```

Then you could dispose it

```dart
connection.dispose();
```
